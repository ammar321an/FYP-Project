## üåü Project Title

**NERF TURRET-INSPIRED GARDEN GUARDIAN: COMPUTER VISION & IOT MONKEY DETERRENCE**

---

## üìú Project Description

This project aims to detect monkeys using an AI model for object detection, ensuring accurate results. The deterrent mechanism employs a 5-inch 30-watt speaker with an amplifier to produce very loud sounds.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Setup**: Place the robot in a high location to guard the garden. The robot's head can move horizontally and vertically to find monkeys.
2. **Buttons**:
    - **Button 1**: Powers on the robot.
    - **Button 2**: Activates manual mode for initial calibration.
    - **Button 3**: Activates AI mode for monkey detection.
3. **WiFi Connection**: The display shows the WiFi or hotspot connection and IP address. Use this IP to open the website on port 5000.
4. **Web Interface**: The website includes live video streaming, registration, and login pages for security. The owner's email and contact number are used for email and WhatsApp notifications.
5. **Detection & Notification**: If a monkey is detected for 3 seconds, the robot emits a sound and sends notifications.
